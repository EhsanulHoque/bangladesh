     <p id="para1"> Bangladesh is a small, lush country in South Asia, located on the Bay of Bengal. <br> is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring Indiaâ€”and shares a small border with Myanmar to its southeast,<br> though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. <br> Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, <br>the largest river delta in the world.The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur <br>and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges.</p>

            <h2 id="warr">History of independence....</h2>
            <p id="para2"> The Bengali population was angered when Prime Minister-elect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman <br>was prevented from taking the office. Civil disobedience erupted across East Pakistan, with calls for independence.<br> Mujib addressed a pro-independence rally of nearly 2 million people <br>in Dacca (as Dhaka used to be spelled in English) on 7 March 1971, where he said, "This time the struggle is for our freedom. <br>This time the struggle is for our independence." The flag of Bangladesh was raised for the first time on 23 March, <br>Pakistan's Republic Day.Later, on 25 March late evening, the Pakistani military junta led by Yahya Khan <br>launched a sustained military assault on East Pakistan under the code name of Operation Searchlight. <br>The Pakistan Army arrested Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and flew him to Karachi</p>
